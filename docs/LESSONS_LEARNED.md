# Lessons Learned - SchoolSync Development

*Last Updated: June 2, 2025*

This document tracks issues encountered during the SchoolSync mobile app development and their solutions for future reference.

## üì± React Native & Expo Issues

### Issue #1: Metro Bundler - Node.js Module Import Error

**Date:** December 2024  
**Severity:** High  
**Platform:** Android Build

#### Problem Description
```
Android Bundling failed
The package at "node_modules\ws\lib\stream.js" attempted to import the Node standard library module "stream".
It failed because the native React runtime does not include the Node standard library.
```

#### Root Cause
- Supabase's `realtime-js` package dependency (`ws`) attempts to import Node.js standard library modules
- React Native doesn't include Node.js standard library modules
- This is a known compatibility issue between Expo and Supabase packages

#### Solution
Disable package exports configuration in Metro bundler:

```javascript
// metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

// Add this line to fix the issue
config.resolver.unstable_enablePackageExports = false;

module.exports = config;
```

- [Expo Metro Config Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/using-libraries/#using-third-party-libraries)

#### Prevention
- Always check package compatibility with React Native before adding dependencies
- Test builds on multiple platforms early in development
- Monitor Expo and Supabase compatibility updates

## üîê Authentication & Database

### Issue #2: Supabase Auth Schema and User Profiles

**Date:** June 2025  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Platform:** Database Architecture

#### Problem Description
Supabase stores authentication users in a separate `auth` schema, which is hidden by default in the dashboard. This can lead to confusion when implementing user profiles, as the auth users are not visible in the default public schema.

#### Solution
Implemented a proper user profile system with these components:

1. Created a `public.users` table that extends `auth.users` with profile fields:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    -- Additional profile fields
    school_id UUID REFERENCES schools(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    role user_role NOT NULL,
    -- Other fields...
);
```

2. Added a database trigger to auto-create profiles when users sign up:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, full_name, role)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.email,
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', NEW.email),
    COALESCE((NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'role')::user_role, 'student'::user_role)
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

3. Updated client code to load user profiles after authentication:
```typescript
// In signUp function
if (data.user) {
  set({ user: data.user, session: data.session });
  await get().loadUserProfile(); // Load profile after signup
  return { success: true };
}
```

#### Best Practices
- Always create a separate profile table in the public schema linked to auth.users
- Use database triggers to automatically create/update profiles
- Implement proper RLS policies on the profile table
- Ensure client code loads profiles after authentication events

### Issue #3: Supabase RLS Policy Configuration

**Date:** December 2024  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Platform:** Database Security

#### Problem Description
Initial database setup without proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies could lead to data access issues.

#### Solution
Implemented comprehensive RLS policies for all tables:

```sql
-- Example: Schools table RLS policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own school" ON schools
  FOR SELECT USING (
    id IN (
      SELECT school_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

#### Best Practices
- Always enable RLS on all tables containing sensitive data
- Test policies with different user roles
- Document policy logic for team understanding

## üé® UI/UX Development

### Issue #4: TypeScript Interface Mismatches

**Date:** December 2024  
**Severity:** Low  
**Platform:** Development

#### Problem Description
Mismatched interfaces between onboarding components and data store caused TypeScript errors.

#### Solution
- Standardized interface definitions in central store
- Updated component props to match store interfaces
- Used consistent naming conventions across components

#### Prevention
- Define interfaces in a central location
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Regular interface audits during development

---

## üì¶ Package Management

### Issue #5: Dependency Version Conflicts

**Date:** December 2024  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Platform:** Development Environment

#### Problem Description
Potential conflicts between Expo SDK version and third-party packages.

#### Solution
- Use Expo-compatible versions of packages
- Check Expo documentation for recommended packages
- Test thoroughly after package updates

#### Best Practices
- Pin dependency versions in package.json
- Use `expo install` for Expo-compatible packages
- Regular dependency audits

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Best Practices Learned

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Always use `.env` files for configuration
   - Never commit sensitive keys to repository
   - Use different environments for development/production

2. **Code Organization**
   - Separate concerns (auth, UI, business logic)
   - Use consistent file naming conventions
   - Implement proper TypeScript typing

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test on multiple platforms early
   - Use development builds for testing native features
   - Implement proper error handling and logging

4. **Database Design**
   - Plan schema carefully before implementation
   - Use proper foreign key relationships
   - Implement comprehensive RLS policies
