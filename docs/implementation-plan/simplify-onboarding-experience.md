# Simplify Onboarding Experience

## Background and Motivation

**Date:** 2025-06-04
**Requested by:** User
**Priority:** Medium

### Current State
The current onboarding process has multiple steps that collect extensive information:
1. Basic Info Step: Collects full name, phone number, and position
2. School Info Step: Collects school name, type, address, city, province, and student count
3. Plan Selection Step: User selects subscription plan
4. Teacher Invite Step: User can invite teachers
5. Welcome Step: Final confirmation

### Problem Statement
The current onboarding experience is too intrusive and lengthy, potentially causing user drop-off. Users are required to provide extensive information upfront that could be collected later or made optional.

### Desired Outcome
Simplify the onboarding experience by:
- Combining "Informasi Dasar" and "Informasi Sekolah" into a single page
- Removing phone number field from basic info
- Removing school address and province fields
- Only collecting essential information: full name and school name
- Making the process less intimidating and faster to complete

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges
1. **Data Structure Updates**: Need to modify OnboardingData interface to make removed fields optional
2. **Component Consolidation**: Merge BasicInfoStep and SchoolInfoStep into a single component
3. **Validation Logic**: Simplify validation to only check required fields (full name and school name)
4. **Step Navigation**: Reduce total steps from 5 to 4 (or potentially 3 if further simplified)
5. **Database Schema**: Ensure removed fields can be null/optional in the database

### UX Considerations
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Allow users to add more details later in their profile
2. **Completion Incentives**: Consider showing completion percentage for optional fields
3. **Onboarding Flow**: Maintain smooth transition between remaining steps

### Compliance Considerations
1. **Data Minimization**: Aligns with privacy best practices by collecting only essential data
2. **Indonesian Localization**: Maintain proper Bahasa Indonesia throughout
3. **Islamic Values**: Ensure simplified flow still respects cultural context
