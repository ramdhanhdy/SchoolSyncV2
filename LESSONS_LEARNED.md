# Lessons Learned - SchoolSync Development

*Last Updated: May 31, 2025*

This document tracks issues encountered during the SchoolSync mobile app development and their solutions for future reference.

## üì± React Native & Expo Issues

### Issue #1: Metro Bundler - Node.js Module Import Error

**Date:** December 2024  
**Severity:** High  
**Platform:** Android Build

#### Problem Description
```
Android Bundling failed
The package at "node_modules\ws\lib\stream.js" attempted to import the Node standard library module "stream".
It failed because the native React runtime does not include the Node standard library.
```

#### Root Cause
- Supabase's `realtime-js` package dependency (`ws`) attempts to import Node.js standard library modules
- React Native doesn't include Node.js standard library modules
- This is a known compatibility issue between Expo and Supabase packages

#### Solution
Disable package exports configuration in Metro bundler:

```javascript
// metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

// Add this line to fix the issue
config.resolver.unstable_enablePackageExports = false;

module.exports = config;
```

- [Supabase Realtime Issue #415](https://github.com/supabase/realtime-js/issues/415)
- [Expo Metro Config Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/using-libraries/#using-third-party-libraries)

#### Prevention
- Always check package compatibility with React Native before adding dependencies
- Test builds on multiple platforms early in development
- Monitor Expo and Supabase compatibility updates

## üîê Authentication & Database

### Issue #2: Supabase RLS Policy Configuration

**Date:** December 2024  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Platform:** Database Security

#### Problem Description
Initial database setup without proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies could lead to data access issues.

#### Solution
Implemented comprehensive RLS policies for all tables:

```sql
-- Example: Schools table RLS policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own school" ON schools
  FOR SELECT USING (
    id IN (
      SELECT school_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

#### Best Practices
- Always enable RLS on all tables containing sensitive data
- Test policies with different user roles
- Document policy logic for team understanding

## üé® UI/UX Development

### Issue #3: TypeScript Interface Mismatches

**Date:** December 2024  
**Severity:** Low  
**Platform:** Development

#### Problem Description
Mismatched interfaces between onboarding components and data store caused TypeScript errors.

#### Solution
- Standardized interface definitions in central store
- Updated component props to match store interfaces
- Used consistent naming conventions across components

#### Prevention
- Define interfaces in a central location
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Regular interface audits during development

---

## üì¶ Package Management

### Issue #4: Dependency Version Conflicts

**Date:** December 2024  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Platform:** Development Environment

#### Problem Description
Potential conflicts between Expo SDK version and third-party packages.

#### Solution
- Use Expo-compatible versions of packages
- Check Expo documentation for recommended packages
- Test thoroughly after package updates

#### Best Practices
- Pin dependency versions in package.json
- Use `expo install` for Expo-compatible packages
- Regular dependency audits

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Best Practices Learned

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Always use `.env` files for configuration
   - Never commit sensitive keys to repository
   - Use different environments for development/production

2. **Code Organization**
   - Separate concerns (auth, UI, business logic)
   - Use consistent file naming conventions
   - Implement proper TypeScript typing

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test on multiple platforms early
   - Use development builds for testing native features
   - Implement proper error handling and logging

4. **Database Design**
   - Plan schema carefully before implementation
   - Use proper foreign key relationships
   - Implement comprehensive RLS policies
